# Flashcard-Creator
Creates basic front-back flashcards, and cloze-deleted flashcards.

## Getting Started

- cloze-card.js and basic-card.js will allow you to create flashcards. At this time, all cards need to be hard-coded.
- playcards.js will allow you to answer the flashcards that have been created. This can be run in Node.

Once you've downloaded the git file to your drive, run 
```
npm init
```
in your console to ensure that you have inquirer installed.
